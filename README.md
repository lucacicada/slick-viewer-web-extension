Missing Features:

This extension is slick and actually amazing, I can't believe you have lived without it all these years!

However, there are some feature that are missing:

❌ Do not work for base64 images, this is a browser limitation...
❌ There are no options, you cannot configure the extension... sad...
❌ No 1:1 ratio, there is no way to display the image at its 1 to 1 ratio...
❌ You cannot get rid of the blurry background... in case you have missed the point 2...
